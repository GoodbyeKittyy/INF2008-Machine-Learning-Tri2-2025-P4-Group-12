# Machine Learning in Supply Chain Planning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project documents our hands-on experience in applying **Machine Learning** techniques to a real-world dataset related to **Supply Chain Planning**. Our goal is to analyze trends and patterns in **Demand Planning** using data-driven methodologies.

## 📖 Introduction
A **Supply Chain** is a comprehensive system that oversees the production and delivery of a product or service. It involves all processes from initial planning to final delivery to end-users.

### 🔗 Supply Chain Planning
Supply Chain Planning focuses on optimizing the manufacturing and distribution of goods, ensuring a balance between shortage and surplus. The process involves **forecasting demand, managing inventory, and improving overall supply chain efficiency**.

In a **Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP)** framework, **demand forecasting** plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal stock levels, minimizing losses, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Machine Learning can enhance demand forecasting by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that drive more accurate predictions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Utilize **Machine Learning** models to analyze supply chain data.
- Identify trends and patterns in **Demand Planning**.
- Optimize inventory management through **data-driven decision-making**.
- Improve overall **supply chain efficiency**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data related to supply chain processes, including:
- 📌 Sales figures
- 📌 Inventory levels
- 📌 Supplier information
- 📌 Customer demand patterns
